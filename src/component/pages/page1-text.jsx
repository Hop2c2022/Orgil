          Since the beginning of the internet, millions and millions and
          millions of blogs have been created. Many have died due to lost
          interest or their owners giving up on the idea, while others have
          thrived and continue to grow, making money and earning their owners a
          steady income. It’s a constant evolution of content that keeps people
          coming back for more, especially if these blogs contact highly
          resourceful material that people find useful and interesting.
